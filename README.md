# Shortcut

This extension was made thinking to make the developer day easier, and have everything on hand.

The shortcuts can be organized in folders.

## Keys

${workspaceFolder}
 You can use this as a shortcut for your workspace folder.
```json
  ${workspaceFolder}\\app\\app.exe
```

# Icons

The menu items are from vscode and the shortcuts themselves are of the theme that is in use.
